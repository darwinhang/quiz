This is a quiz based on the javascriptissexy.com learn js in 6 weeks blog post.
The quiz is hosted at http://winious.com/fun/quiz/index.html

## Notes
- I'm trying to go back and clean up code that I had written when I first started learning JS, back in the fall of 2013.
- Looking at this code and it is so terrible, I need to improve this if I'm going to leave it up here.

## Todo
- [ ] Use bower for dependency management
- [ ] Don't store answers in `js` file
- [ ] Organize code 
- [ ] Delete things I no longer need
- [ ] Basically Redo whole application, make it modular
- [ ] Add tests
